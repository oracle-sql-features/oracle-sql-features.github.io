= Native SQL Support for Query Row Limits and Row Offsets
:database-version: 12.1.0.1
:database-category: SQL

[[feature_summary]]

Many SQL queries benefit from limiting the result set to the top-_n_, or first _n_ rows. 

Before Oracle 12c Release 1 limiting the result set required the use of sub-selects and the rownum pseudo-column and inline views as you can see in the first examples. When Oracle Database 12c introduced support for the https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf/SELECT.html#GUID-CFA006CA-6FF1-4972-821E-6996142A51C6__BABBADDD[row limiting clause] selecting the first _n_ rows from a result set, or paging through a result set were significantly improved.

== Benefits

The FETCH FIRST and OFFSET clauses provides native SQL language support to limit the number of rows returned and to specify a starting row for the return set.

Many queries need to limit the number of rows returned or offset the starting row of the results. For example, top-N queries sort their result set and then return only the first n rows. FETCH FIRST and OFFSET simplify syntax and comply with the ANSI SQL standard.
