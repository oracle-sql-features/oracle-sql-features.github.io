= SELECT without FROM clause
:database-version: 23.2.0
:database-category: sql

You can now run SELECT expression-only queries without a FROM clause, e.g. adding `from dual` is no longer needed in such cases. The `DUAL` table has not disappeared, all queries that use it will continue to work as expected.
