= Identity Columns
:database-version: 12.1.0.1
:database-category: sql

The identity columns feature can be used to designate one column in the table as the identity for the row.
The database will automatically assign an increasing integer value from a sequence generator to the identity column for each subsequent INSERT statement.
This feature is sometimes also referred to as `autoincrement`.

*This feature is part of the ISO SQL:2016 standard.*

To declare a column as an identity in a table, use the `GENERATED AS IDENTITY` column attribute:

[source,sql]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
CREATE TABLE employees
(
   id           NUMBER        GENERATED AS IDENTITY NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
   first_name   VARCHAR2(10),
   last_name    VARCHAR2(10)                        NOT NULL,
   job_title    VARCHAR2(20)                        NOT NULL
);
----

The identity column provides additional syntax modifiers to:

* Always generate a new identity value, via `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`
* Generate a new identity value if none has been provided, via `GENERATED BY DEFAULT`
* Generate a new identity value if one has been provided by evaluates to `NULL`, via `GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL`
* Provide additional identity generation options via `GENERATED AS IDENTITY (<identity_options>)`

  2    VALUES ('Andres', 'Almiray', 'Developer');

1 row inserted.

SQL> INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, job_title)

1 row inserted.

SQL> COMMIT;

== Benefits

The first relational normal form dictates that each table has to have a primary key by which a row can be uniquely identified (i.e. only one row exists for a given primary key value).
Sometimes data records contain "natural primary keys" that uniquely identify themselves, such as the user name for a `customer_accounts` table, the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) for a `cars` table, the driver license id for a `driver _licenses` table.
However, often such natural primary keys do not exist within the data records and need to instead be generated, which is where identity columns can help.

Identity columns ensure that the value for a new row will always be unique by using an always incrementing integer value that will never be used twice.
