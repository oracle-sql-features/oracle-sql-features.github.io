= SQL

SQL is the set-based, high-level declarative (4GL) computer language with which
all programs and users access data in a relational database.

SQL unifies tasks such as the following in one consistent language:

* Creating, replacing, altering, and dropping objects
* Inserting, updating, and deleting table rows
* Querying and analyzing data
* Controlling access to the database and its objects
* Guaranteeing database consistency and integrity

SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986
and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.

Oracle SQL includes many extensions to the ANSI/ISO standard SQL language,
and Oracle Database tools and applications provide additional statements.
